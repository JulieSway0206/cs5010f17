    How to Submit Your Homework
  </h2>
  <p>
    In this course, we will use a local (Enterprise) GitHub
    as our version control and repository system.
    That GitHub site is located at
    <a href="http://github.ccs.neu.edu/">
      github.ccs.neu.edu.
    </a>
    You should visit this site as soon as you have a CCIS ID
    so you can initialize your account there.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will create a private repository for you at the GitHub site
    for CS 5010.  We expect you to commit and push your work to
    this repository at the end of every work session.
    When begin to work in pairs, we will create a repository
    for each pair, shared between you and your partner.
  </p>
  <p class="clear">
    At the end of each work session, you must do three things:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Fill out a
      <a href="yourID-log.txt">
        work session report
      </a>
      and place it within your repository, outside of
      the directories you created for the problem sets.
    </li>
    <li>
      Commit and push that work session report.
    </li>
    <li>
      Commit and push all of the files in the directory
      that contains the solution you are developing for
      the current problem set.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    You must also fill out a form describing your preferences
    for codewalk times the following week, but you only have
    to do that once a week, before Saturday evening.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do not commit and push your files daily,
    we will assume you are not working on the assignment.
    If you commit and push only the final version of your
    assignment, we will suspect you stole the code from
    somewhere.  Even if you wrote all the code yourself,
    violating course rules by not pushing intermediate versions
    may lower your grade.
  </p>
  <p>
    Checking in your partially-completed assignments also serves
    as a backup in case something happens to the files on your
    personal machine.
    (Your dog won't eat the GitHub site.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Your homework will be collected automatically from your
    repository at the date and time listed on the problem set
    (usually 6pm local time on Monday).
  </p>
  <p>
    Your homework for problem set <var>JJ</var> should be committed and
    pushed to your repository in a directory named
    <code>set</code><var>JJ</var>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Problem sets may contain more than one part.  Each part
      should be submitted as a single file within your
      <code>set</code><var>JJ</var> directory.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some parts of a problem set may specify the name of the
      file you are to use.  If so, use that file name.
    </li>
    <li>
      If part <var>K</var> of a problem set does not specify a
      file name, then your solution for that part should go into
      a file named <code>q</code><var>J</var><code>.rkt</code>.
      For example: In Problem Set 01, your solution to part 2
      (Exercise 14) goes into a file named
      <code>set01/q2.rkt</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If your solution is in a file named
      <code>set1/q2.rkt</code>, <code>Set01/q2.rkt</code>,
      <code>set01/question2.rkt</code>, or any other name
      that is different from the one and only correct name,
      then our automated testing scripts won't find your file
      and a variety of bad things will happen.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Be sure to include all of the
    <a href="deliverables.html">
      deliverables.
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    We have specified
    <a href="style.html">
      coding conventions
    </a>
    we expect you to use for this course.
    Following those conventions will improve your life and ours.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your problem sets will be graded according to the
    <a href="grading.html">
      rubric we have described.
    </a>
    Some details and points of emphasis will change from week to
    week, but those general standards will remain the same
    throughout the course.
