  <p>
    Most online materials will be at this web site.
    We will try to make the materials readable on most modern systems
    and browsers, but you should not expect them to be readable on
    cell phones or other devices with small screens.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Piazza
  </h3>
  <p>
    We will use
    <i href="piazza.com/northeastern/spring2017/cs5010/home">
      Piazza
    </i>
    as our primary platform for announcements, questions, discussions,
    and so forth.
    Don't send email to the instructor or TAs unless it is absolutely
    necessary.  Use Piazza instead.  Piazza allows you to create
    private messages, seen only by the instructor and TAs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Don't post your code or designs
    </strong>
    in a public post.
    If you are asking a question that is relevant only to your
    own solution, make it a private question.
    Better yet, think of a way to ask your question without
    giving anything away about your own solution or ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Before you post a question,
    </strong>
    read through the existing threads to see
    whether your question has already been answered.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Make your subject line descriptive.
    </strong>
    For example, "what if mouse is dragged outside canvas?" is
    far more informative than "please help me"
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Tag your posts.
    </strong>
    Piazza uses hashtags, like Twitter.
    I've created some standard tags (called <em>folders</em> in Piazza)
    that will help you (and us) to categorize your posts.
    These appear under the "Note Tags" box so you can select them
    with a click:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>ps1</code>, <code>ps2</code> (etc) for questions
      about problem sets
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>gradebook</code> for questions about grading
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>logistics</code> for questions about scheduling and such
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>#systems</code> for inquiries about the various
      computer systems we use.  This is where you can ask
      questions about <code>git</code>, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can also create other hashtags.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Feel free to respond to other students' posts.
    </strong>
    We won't hold it against you if your response is incorrect.
    Indeed, incorrect responses help us to identify things the class
    doesn't understand.
