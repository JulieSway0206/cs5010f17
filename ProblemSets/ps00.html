    CS 5010: Problem Set 00

    <p>
      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give us some idea of
      your programming skills at the beginning of the semester, when
      most of you are just starting the MS program.  This problem set
      will also allow us to identify students whose programming skills
      are strong enough for us to invite them to take a programming
      test that could result in this course being waived for those
      students.  Students who do not do well on Problem Set 00 will
      not be allowed to take that placement test.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Problem Set 00 may be too hard for you to finish before
      its due date, in which case you should still submit a plain text
      (Latin-1 or UTF-8) file named <code>README</code>
      (not <code>README.txt</code>) that says
      <code>Problem Set 00 is too hard for me.</code>  Students who submit a
      <code>README</code> file that begins with that sentence will receive full
      credit for Problem Set 00, but will not be allowed to take the
      placement test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students who are able to complete the problem set should create
      a <code>README</code> file that tells us how to compile and run
      your program
      on a Linux, Macintosh, or Windows machine (your choice, but
      please specify your choice in the <code>README</code> file).
      You may use an
      integrated development environment (IDE) to write your program,
      but you must submit your program as a set of plain text source
      files.  Do not submit your program using any formats that would
      make sense only when viewed or interpreted by an IDE.  If we
      cannot read, compile, and run your program without having to use
      an IDE, we will assume Problem Set 00 was too hard for you.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Submitting Your Solution
    </h3>
    <p>
      A third purpose of this problem set is to make sure all MS
      students have obtained a CCIS account, know how to use <code>sftp</code>
      to transfer files between machines, and can use Linux well enough
      to package files and to submit them by following these
      instructions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li value="0">
        If you're using a personal computer, make sure the <code>ssh</code>
        and <code>sftp</code> utilities are installed on your machine.  If not,
        install them.
        (If you're using Linux, they should already be installed.
        If you're using a Macintosh, you can install those utilities by
        installing the Xcode Command Line Tools.  If you're using a
        Windows machine, you may have to install a freeware version of
        those utilities such as PuTTY or OpenSSH.)
      </li>
      <li>
        When you have obtained a CCIS account, you will have a home
        directory on the CCIS shared file system.  Log into a CCIS
        Linux machine (in WVH 102, or you can use the
        <code>ssh</code> utility to log
        in remotely), and create a <code>~/classes/problem00</code> directory as
        follows:
        <pre>
          % mkdir classes
          % cd classes
          % mkdir problem00
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the <code>sftp</code> utility to copy your <code>README</code>
        and program files
        into the directory you created in step 1.  Suppose, for example,
        that your CCIS ID is <code>sidewinder</code>, you have written
        your program
        in Java, and your <code>README</code> file along with all of your Java
        files reside in some directory on your own personal computer.  Then
        you can open a terminal window (called a Command Prompt window
        on Windows machines) on your computer, <code>cd</code> to the
        directory that
        contains your files, and copy them to the CCIS shared file
        system as follows:
        <pre>
          % sftp sidewinder@login.ccs.neu.edu
          sidewinder@login.ccs.neu.edu's password: 
          Connected to login.ccs.neu.edu
          sftp> cd classes/problem00
          sftp> put README
          sftp> mput *.java
          sftp> bye
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Log into a CCIS Linux machine, use the <code>tar</code> utility to
        create a <code>problem00.tgz</code> file that packages your entire
        <code>classes/problem00</code>
        directory into a single compressed file, and submit that file
        using the <code>/course/cs5010sp17/submit</code> program.  For example:
        <pre>
          % ssh sidewinder@login.ccs.neu.edu
          % cd classes
          % tar -czf problem00.tgz problem00
          % /course/cs5010sp17/submit sidewinder 0 problem00.tgz
        </pre>
        (Use your own CCIS ID instead of <code>sidewinder</code>.  The 0 in the
        last line means this is a submission for Problem Set 00.)
      </li>
      <li>
        If all goes well, step 3 will end by giving you a
        confirmation number.  Please write down that confirmation number
        so you can prove you have submitted Problem Set 00.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
      Problem Specification
    </h3>
    <p>
      The program you are to write solves a simple flight scheduling
      problem:  What is the quickest way to get from one airport to
      another using a given set of scheduled flights?
    </p>
    <p>
      You may write your program using any language that is currently
      installed and available on
      <code>
        login.ccs.neu.edu
      </code>
      (which is a CCIS Linux machine).
    </p>
    <p>
      Your program must provide three public operations named
      <code>canGetThere</code>,
      <code>fastestItinerary</code>, and
      <code>travelTime</code>.
      Those operations are specified below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your implementation of those operations must use an immutable
      abstract data type <code>Flight</code>, specified below, together with a
      <code>ListOfFlight</code> data type whose values are homogeneous lists of
      values drawn from the <code>Flight</code> ADT; the
      <code>ListOfFlight</code> data type
      should use lists that are idiomatic in your chosen programming
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make this problem set easier for you, we are giving you
      <a href="#samples">
        sample implementations
      </a>
      of the <code>Flight</code> ADT and
      <code>ListOfFlight</code> data
      type, written in several different programming languages.  If
      you choose to use one of the programming languages we used to
      write those sample implementations, you may use the sample
      implementation we give you for that language.  If your chosen
      programming language is not among those we used for the sample
      implementations, then you will need to translate one of the
      sample implementations into your language of choice, taking care
      to preserve the <code>Flight</code> ADT's immutability, operations,
      types, and specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your implementation may also define its own data types, and may
      use any data types that are provided by the programming language
      you use, including its standard libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      To qualify for the placement test, your implementation must be
      correct and reasonably efficient.  It should, for example, take
      no more than a few seconds to find the shortest itineraries that
      connect every pair of airports served by the flights listed in
      the <code>deltaFlights</code> example defined by the sample
      implementations.
    </p>
